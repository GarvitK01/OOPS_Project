         Task-It is a hassle-free reminder app, built from the ground up for Android - it’s beautiful, elegant and  simple. This app lets you set reminders - and it will notify you when they are scheduled to be performed.

________________________________________________________________________________

        This application was developed on **Android Studio** and requires-



* Minimum SDK Version-23
* Target SDK Version-30

      Some of the main features of our application includes-

1. Gmail and Facebook signup of the user along with conventional sign in options. 
2. OTP Verification of the user via the mobile number and email with the flexibility being provided to choose any of these two methods the user wants.
3. Giving users the option to** choose priority indicators**(High, Low or Medium) via colour patterns in the to-do,notes and stocks list as well as letting the user set a custom reminder with Notifications on the time they set.
4. The feasibility of letting the users place **calls to carpenters, electricians, plumbers (task.it provides the user with their contacts)** etc making this app a go to place for all the important maintenance or repairs.
5. Under each category in the dashboard, users can add existing materials like groceries with quantity, books, furniture, grooming materials. The app automatically adds the date the entry is made. The search bar and edit quantity feature lets them edit the details and help in finding the desired information regarding the quantity or task in one go. They can also delete the notes just with a swipe after they are done with the task.
6. Users can share the details of to-do lists from their dashboard with any of their friends, relatives and colleagues through Gmail, WhatsApp or any other social media platform.

Assumptions while making the app-



1. The firebase database used for the app has a limited number of users. As of now, the user base isn’t exceeding the normal limit.
2. Considering the small target audience,we have restricted the database of the service staff.However we can extend it with the growing number of users.

 

The app starts with the **Login page** for the existing user and provides an option to sign up to new users.The sign up can also be done via **Google or Facebook login** as mentioned above.The register page takes user information to provide a friendly interface once the user enters the world of **task.it**.

                                                         ** Login Page App View**

We’ve used **Regular Expressions **for checking username and phone numbers, mobile number has to be of 10 digits and password minimum 8 characters so this check is done by using regular expressions.

          

In the** User Verification** window the country code picker automatically selects the national calling code and sends an **OTP** directly to the phone number which will be on the device.
